# Modern Web Design

An attempt at building a simple website using Modern Web Standards. The idea with this project is to write the html, css and javascript from scratch to see if it is possible without any dependency on any framework. 

I want to achieve the following

1. Fully W3C Validated HTML Code
2. Fully W3C Validated CSS Code
3. Website built with Accessibility in Mind
4. Website that is responsive across a wide range of devices
